"""One (model, task, depth, shard) generation job.

  python -m prod.generate --model=ouro_1_4b_base --task=gsm8k --k=4 \
      [--protocol=natural|forced] [--n=N] [--shard=0 --shards=1] [--adapter=DIR] \
      [--caps=0,16,32,64,128,256,512] [--extra-caps=48,96,192,384] [--horizon=512] \
      [--batch-cap=32] [--mem-fraction=0.85] [--tag-loops --tag-tokens] [--out=DIR] \
      [--batch-width=N] [--no-mask] [--wall-clock] [--resume-from-chains]
      [--continue-chains=think_tag|horizon] [--protocol-tag=natural2]
      [--continue-from-cells=FILE] [--old-horizon=N]

Protocol (natural stop), ported from s32_run.py and s28_common:
  generate once at the horizon with the model's own stop rule, then cut(B) = trace[:min(B, natural
  stop)] and run ONE forced read-out per DISTINCT cut length, serving every budget that shares it.
  Both parses are stored per cap, and protocol v2 is computed from the stored fields (decision D1).

Protocol (continuation of a stored chain), `--continue-chains=<mode>` on the natural protocol:
  the chains sidecar of a finished natural-stop job is replayed as the prefix (prefill, exactly as
  --resume-from-chains does) and greedy decoding CARRIES ON: think_tag continues the rows whose
  chain ended at the closing think tag past it, horizon continues the rows that reached the old
  horizon out to the new one. The cuts and the forced read-outs are recomputed at every cap for
  those rows; every other row, and every cap at or below a continued row's old stop, is copied from
  the old cells file, whose prefix is identical there. The output is a SEPARATE grid under
  --protocol-tag (default natural2), and neither the source cells file nor the chains sidecar is
  ever written.

Protocol (forced continuation), ported from s13_common.decode(stopper=...) / make_stopper:
  no row ever stops; a token that would stop is replaced by the "Wait," tokens, so every row emits
  exactly `horizon` tokens. GSM8K and MATH500 on the Ouro checkpoints only.

Pinned by the rulings on PP2 protocol decisions (PLAN.md, 2026-09-12):
  * batch width 16 in every production run (Q6 clause iv), stored per row as `batch_width` with the
    actual group size of the generation and of the read-out beside it. `--batch-width=0` restores the
    adaptive KV-ceiling width and exists for the gates, which reproduce spikes that ran that way.
  * the forced read-out is truncated at its eos, KEEPING the eos token, in every family (Q8 option
    O1: the rule of S13, S26, S32 and of every analysis of record). Where the strip removed text, the
    row also carries `nostrip` = what the answer would have been without it, so gate G1 can attribute
    a mismatch against the S9a-family spikes to the strip rule with no second generation.
  * forced continuation defaults to the spike's N (GSM8K 300, MATH500 500; Q2 option O1) and `--n`
    overrides it. The full-N forced block is priced separately (protocol decision Q15).

Every hyperparameter above is an argument; nothing is hard-coded in a driver.
Resumable at (problem, cut) granularity: traces and cells are append-only jsonl, re-read on start.
