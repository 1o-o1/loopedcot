"""Huginn-0125 adapter. Everything decoding-related is in raven.py; this file is the registry row.

Facts of record, with their source:
  * structure prelude 2 / core 4 / coda 2, so layer passes per token = 4 + 4k
    (s9c_common's header, confirmed from config.json: n_layers_in_prelude 2,
    n_layers_in_recurrent_block 4, n_layers_in_coda 2)
  * depth set {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32} (Brief PP2; H-C's exponential grid)
  * trained depth 32 (config mean_recurrence = 32). LEDGER 2026-09-04 S4: "Huginn's trained default
    of 32 steps is past its optimum on GSM8K; 16 steps match 32 on average and beat it on half the
    problems."
  * PAD_ID 65509 and STOP_IDS [65504, 65505, 65508] (begin_text, end_text, end_turn) from
    s9c_common, which read them out of `_get_stops` line 1605
  * `compile_mask` is NEVER called: LEDGER 2026-09-04 S4, "Huginn's released compile_mask has an
    operator-precedence bug that makes the prelude non-causal on padded batches when embed_inputs is
    used; the normal forward avoids it because it never calls compile_mask. Any Huginn per-step
    analysis must build the prelude the forward() way." raven.py only ever calls `model(...)`, i.e.
    the normal forward, and supplies its own mask through the attention patch.
